+ To create a new user make a POST request to http://localhost:3000/user with the body:
```
{
	"displayName": "Slava",
	"email": "slava@mail.ru",
	"password": "111111"
}
```

+ Sign in and get a JWT by sending POST request to http://localhost:3000/login with the body:

{
	"email": "slava@mail.ru",
	"password": "111111"
